# chronicler

Chronicler is a command line java application which takes some time sheet reporting source, parses it, and uploads it to Rally time sheets.

I suppose it could also be flexible about where the destination is, and perhaps could be more than Rally one day.

## Source plugins

Included is a plugin for [Hamster](https://github.com/projecthamster/hamster) activity reports.
